//React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components
//  in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL
// BrowserRouter is used for doing client side routing with URL segments. You can load a top level component for each 
// route. This helps separate concerns in your app and makes the logic/data flow more clear
// What is routing in react JS?
// In web application, Routing is a process of binding a web URL to a specific resource in the web application. 
// In React, it is binding an URL to a component. React does not support routing natively as it is basically an user interface library.
